"""Deterministic eval: hidden answer-key grading for the audio adaptation consideration.

This task uses a deterministic scorer backed by a hidden answer key in
`Sample.metadata["answer_key"]`. The key is not sent to the model; only the prompt and
system context are.

These checks cover stable, factual consideration content that should reliably be
triggered by the evaluation context, including assistive-technology categories,
named assistive technologies, consideration-specific exploration strategies,
scope-specific interaction contexts, inherited shared strategies, and
bounded behaviors for audio clarity, captions as supplement, and unreliable
audio cues, including scenario tasks for complex pages and communication-heavy
interfaces.

Run with:

    python -m tests.evals \
        copilot/gpt-5-mini \
        deterministic/audio_adaptation.py

    python -m tests.evals \
        copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5 \
        deterministic/audio_adaptation.py
