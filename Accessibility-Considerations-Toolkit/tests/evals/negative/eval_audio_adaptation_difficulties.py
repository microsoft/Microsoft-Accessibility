"""Negative eval: audio adaptation barriers caused by poor audio support.

This task follows the scenario-based negative-test pattern for consideration files:
provide a bad interface scenario that should be judged as NOT meeting the
consideration's needs.

Run with:

    python -m tests.evals tests/evals/negative/eval_audio_adaptation_difficulties.py
