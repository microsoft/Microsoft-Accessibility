"""Eval: audio adaptation consideration (clause 4.2.5).

Five sub-tests verifying the consideration file transfers SME knowledge:

- AT recall
- Exploration strategy recall
- Interaction context recall
- Heuristic lens override application
- Shared inheritance awareness

Each sub-test is a separate `@task` so it has its own rubric. Run with:

    python -m tests.evals tests/evals/considerations/eval_audio_adaptation.py

Use `--consideration_context_mode all` to run the same tasks with all
elaborated considerations loaded in background context, while still grading
hard-of-hearing answers.

Add `-T` to limit to one sub-test, e.g. `--task at_recall`.
